I have an organization of my audio files such as:

- Artists/Albums/Titles

- Also I have some titles that don't belong in any album under the Artists root directory.

There were a lot of artists i did not care about much besides from one song or two and they created too much clutter. I wrote this script to move those artists under a folder called "Other". Now in my main music directory I can see the musicians I really love :) 

- One note, if you have songs from an artist called "Other" things may get interesting.
